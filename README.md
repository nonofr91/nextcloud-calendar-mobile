## ✨ Features

### Multiple Calendar Views
Switch seamlessly between five view modes:
- **Month**, full month overview
- **Week**, 7-day scrollable view
- **3-Day**, compact multi-day view
- **Day**, single-day detail view
- **Schedule/Agenda**, chronological event list

### CalDAV Sync
Full two-way sync with any Nextcloud instance using the CalDAV protocol. Events are fetched, parsed (iCalendar/ICS), and persisted to a local-first WatermelonDB store, kept current through per-calendar delta sync.

### Multi-Account Support
Add and switch between multiple Nextcloud accounts. Each account's calendars are shown with per-calendar visibility toggles and color coding.

### Event Management
Create, view, and edit calendar events with support for:
- Title, description, location
- All-day and timed events
- Attendee lists with display names
- Recurring event detection
- **Find a time / Free-Busy** — check attendee availability via CalDAV and drag the event to a free slot

### Nextcloud Talk Integration
Optionally attach a Nextcloud Talk room to any event at creation time, the Talk link is stored in the event and surfaced in the event detail view.

### Home Screen Widgets & Live Activities
Keep your agenda glanceable without opening the app:
- **iOS home widgets**, small, medium, and large sizes showing your upcoming agenda, plus lock-screen accessory widgets
- **Android home widget**, upcoming events on your home screen
- **iOS Live Activity**, the next or ongoing event with a live countdown, shown on the Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island

Widgets are kept up to date through the app's background sync, and tapping an event deep-links straight into its detail view.

### Theming & Personalization
- Light, dark, and system-auto theme modes
- Adjustable zoom level (hour row height: 45–120 px)
- Configurable week start day (Sunday or Monday)
